User Guide for Mips Tracer
This Mips tracer is easily understandable and highly scalable incase if more instructions has to be traced in future.
All the Modules in the MIPS architecture diagram from Hennesey and Paterrson is realised as seperate functions.
To use this program:
1. Copy MIPSCompilerFinalCPP.pdf, paste in any location of your local computer.
2. Now copy the contents of MIPSCompilerFinalCPP and paste it in a plain text file, save as test.cpp.
3. Open command prompt, change directory to location of your .cpp file (eg., cd ../mipspath/)
4. Compile g++ filename.cpp (g++ test.cpp -o MIPSTracer) 
5. This will generate output file named as (e.g.): MIPSTracer.out in the same directory.
6. Type the output filename MIPSTracer in command prompt, all set to trace the path for add, sub, lw, sw, and beq MIPS command.
